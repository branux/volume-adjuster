volume-adjuster
===============

Simple script that auto-adjusts pulseaudio volume so you don't have to keep fiddling with the volume.

Open up your command line and run `./volume-adjuster.py`

If anyone out there knows how to get the levels for the different syncs please let me know.  I couldn't figure out how to get stream_read_cb to work with the different sinks.
